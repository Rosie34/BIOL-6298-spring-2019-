# BIOL 6298 Project

My project paper is "Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks in human rDNA units are produced in vivo" and I will reproduce figure 1B.
  - Tchurikov, N. A. et al. Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks in human rDNA units are produced in vivo. Sci. Rep. 6, 25866; doi: 10.1038/srep25866 (2016).
- For short summary of my paper: There are nine hot spots of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human rDNA units and authors investigated to identify whether these hot spots are generated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the pattern of DSB biomarkers, H2AX and γ-H2AX.
- My figure is a heatmap based on ChIp-Seq data and it shows the correlation between DSB hot spots, H2AX, and γ-H2AX. This figure confirms these nine hot spots are the results of in vivo DNA breakage.

- For data: all ChIp-Seq data are available on NCBI GEO database

  - wgEncodeEH001779 (for KAP1 in HEK293 cells)
  - GSE25577 (for H2AX and γ-H2AX in CD4+ and Jurkat cells)
  - GSM776558 (for GATA3 in Th1 cells)
  - GSM776557 (for T-bet in Th1 cells)
